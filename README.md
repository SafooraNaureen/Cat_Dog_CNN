# Convolutional Neural Networks for Cat\Dog image identification

This projects aims to use Convolutional Neural Networks to identify cat and dog images after training and testing on a data containing 10,000 images of cats and dogs. 

- Applied Convolutional Neural Networks and built a model to identify cats and dogs using keras tensorflow.

- Deployed the model as a website on local machine using flask and html.
